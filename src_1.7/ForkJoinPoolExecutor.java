/**
 * An implementation of {@link ExperimentExecutor} using a {@link ForkJoinPool}
 * (introduced in Java 1.7) to execute tasks. This pretty much simplifies code
 * compared to {@link ThreadPoolExecutor}, as we don't have to care about
 * possible starvation of worker threads waiting for sub-experiments to
 * complete.
